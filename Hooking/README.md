Arduino Command Injector ü§ñ
This project demonstrates a clever way to intercept and modify commands sent to an Arduino from a Linux application, all done at runtime. It's a fun way to explore system-level hooking without touching the original program's code!

üéØ What It Does
Imagine you have a program (like our communication app) that sends a specific character, say '1', to your Arduino to trigger an action (e.g., turn on an LED). This project allows you to "inject" yourself into that process. Even if the communication app tries to send '1', your Arduino might receive '3' instead, thanks to the magic happening behind the scenes.

In short, it lets you re-route and alter serial commands on the fly.

üöÄ How It Works (Briefly)
Your communication program sends data to your Arduino via the serial port using standard Linux write() system calls.

A special library (arduino_hook.so) is built to contain your own version of the write() function.

When you run your communication program, you tell Linux to load your arduino_hook.so library first using the LD_PRELOAD environment variable.

Because your library is loaded first, whenever communication tries to write() to the serial port, it calls your custom write() function in arduino_hook.so instead of the system's original one.

Your custom write() function then inspects the data, modifies it (e.g., changes '1' to '3', '2' to '1', '3' to '2' as implemented), and then passes the modified data to the original system write() function to send it to the Arduino.

This all happens seamlessly in the background, without needing to recompile or modify the communication program itself!

‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
Linux: This project relies on specific Linux features.

GCC: The GNU C Compiler.

Arduino Board & Sketch: An Arduino with a simple sketch designed to respond to serial commands.

Serial Port Permissions: Your user needs permission to access the Arduino's serial port (e.g., /dev/ttyACM0). If you encounter issues, you might need to add your user to the dialout group: sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER (then log out and back in).

üõ†Ô∏è Compilation & Usage
Compiling Your Code
We use a Makefile to simplify the compilation process. This will build both your main communication executable and the arduino_hook.so library.

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd arduino-command-injector
Compile the project:

Bash

make
This command creates two important files in your project directory:

communication: Your main serial communication program.

arduino_hook.so: Your shared library containing the custom write() function.

Running with LD_PRELOAD
To use your command injector, you need to run your communication program with the LD_PRELOAD environment variable set to point to your arduino_hook.so library.

Ensure your Arduino sketch is uploaded and your Arduino is connected.

Open your terminal and execute:

Bash

LD_PRELOAD=./arduino_hook.so ./communication
Now, when you type characters like '1', '2', or '3' into the communication program, arduino_hook.so will intercept and modify them before they reach your Arduino!

(Press q or Q to exit the communication program.)

üõ°Ô∏è Disclaimer
This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only. Using techniques like LD_PRELOAD on systems you don't own or have explicit permission to modify is illegal and unethical. Please use this code responsibly and only on your own systems.
